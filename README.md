Awesome start page is a collection of custom web page for your browser you can set to home and new tab

## Should work
- Google Chrome
- Ms Edge (Use this [extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/custom-new-tab-page/ljabenhdllbfiglklhlmoecabdkmkjkp) for setting a custom file as start page)
- Firefox

> You can customise the html file as per your requirement
>> Use some kind of extension if your browser (eg. edge) doesn't allow setting a file/url as a custom start/new tab page
>> You need an api key for weather updates and may allow location permission if asked.

## Request a new page
Open an issue, describe the things you want and I'll try and make and update the repo
